# Directory Re-Sorter

Directory Re-Sorter is a Windows desktop application, originally created for re-sorting folders within a directory.
Re-sorting is a process where you add numerical prefixes to folders so that when used with Windows Explorer's default sorting,
which is by name, the folders will be sorted in the way you want them to be.

Here is an example;

Default:

```
Folder1
Folder2
Folder3
```

Re-sorted:

```
1- Folder3
2- Folder1
3- Folder2
```

## Prefixer

Prefixer is a side feature of Directory Re-Sorter, which allows you to mass rename files with a certain prefix.

Here is an example;

Default:

```
file1
file2
file3
```

Prefixed:

```
p_file1
p_file2
p_file3
```

## Suffixer

Suffixer is another side feature of Directory Re-Sorter, which allows you to mass rename files with a certain suffix.

Here is an example;

Default:

```
file1
file2
file3
```

Prefixed:

```
file1_s
file2_s
file3_s
```
